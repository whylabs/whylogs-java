## WhyLogs Java

Besides the Java SDK (OpenJDK, preferrably), you'll need to install a couple of things:

* Install Google Java Format plugin for IntelliJ (https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
* Make sure you enable Gradle build

## Building and Testing
* To build, run `./gradlew build`
* To test, run `./gradlew test`
